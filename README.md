Hi, I'm Adam and I'm a Software Developer for the Devon & Somerset Fire & Rescue Service.
I'm interested in Java, React and microservice technologies. My hobbies include gaming, motorcycle riding and science-fiction.
I'm currently learning as much as I can within Java, React and SQL, working towards a degree in computer science.
